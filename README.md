# purplecrayon
An SVG library for GoLang

`purplecrayon` aims to force the programmer to be descriptive rather than declarative.
For instance, when you want to draw a rectangle, you ask `purplecrayon` for a rectangle and
describe the rectangle to it rather than declaring a rectangle and telling `purplecrayon` that you've
done so.
